One thing that I appreciated most in finishing up this project was getting to connect the dots on all the different components we touched on throughout my degree plan. I had studied working with databases, but hadn't gotten to connect it to a website, I had worked with HTML, CSS, and JS, but hadn't gotten an assignment putting much of it together. I've put these things together in my own personal projects, but I hadn't received much feedback on what could be improved. This was an opportunity to put all of these concepts together and recieve dedicated feedback on how it all went.
