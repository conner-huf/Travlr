One thing that I appreciated most in finishing up this project was getting to connect the dots on all the different components we touched on throughout my degree plan. I had studied working with databases, but hadn't gotten to connect it to a website, I had worked with HTML, CSS, and JS, but hadn't gotten an assignment putting much of it together. I've put these things together in my own personal projects, but I hadn't received much feedback on what could be improved. This was an opportunity to put all of these concepts together and recieve dedicated feedback on how it all went.

- Angular follows a more elaborate structure and is used for building front-end applications. Whereas Express is used for basic server-side functionality and uses a much simpler structure.
SPA functionality typically can provide a much more positive user experience and can update in real time without needing to reload the whole page. However, this usually means that the SPA requires a longer initial load time for the whole application to be downloaded up front.
- The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database to store the information for the different trips available on the site. This has some advantages compared to SQL in that it provides high performance read and write operations.
- JSON is basically made up of objects and arrays and Javascript is a programming language typically used to manipulate the DOM to update webpages.
- This course helped in illustrating how development should look from start to finish. I specifically appreciated the use of Git and Github throughout the course, as I'm pretty sure that will be an absolutely necessary skill to have in the profession.
